Stage 3 â€“ Customer Churn Prediction (ANN)

This repository contains the Stage 3 Predictive Modeling Deliverables for Group 1, focusing on developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict telecom customer churn.

Files & Deliverables Mapping
1. Defined Architecture of ANN Model

File: Defined Architecture of ANN model.docx

Description: Specifies ANN architecture (input features, hidden layers, dropout, output layer), preprocessing steps, training parameters, and evaluation metrics.

2. Trained ANN Model on Provided Dataset

File: ann_training.ipynb

Description: Jupyter notebook that loads the dataset, preprocesses data, builds and trains the ANN using Adam optimizer & binary crossentropy loss, and applies early stopping for robust optimisation.

3. Predicted Customer Churn and Evaluated Performance

File: ann_prediction.ipynb

Description: Notebook that uses the trained ANN to predict customer churn and evaluates performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

ðŸ“Œ Notes for Assessors

The Final Report (PDF) with key findings, factors, recommendations, and limitations has been submitted separately on Canvas (per instructions).

The Video Demonstration (MP4) has also been uploaded separately on Canvas.

This GitHub repo only includes the Predictive Modeling Deliverables as required.
